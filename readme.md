# Hands on my laptop üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Member: Mashkoor Asim k

### Project Description
Project Description:
Automated Face-Tracking and Targeting System with Blacklist Alert
This project develops a real-time face recognition and tracking system integrated with an automated targeting mechanism. Using computer vision with OpenCV, servo-controlled hardware, and Arduino, the system detects and tracks a specific individual ("Mashkoor") while continuously monitoring for blacklisted persons. Upon detecting a blacklisted individual continuously for more than 5 seconds, the system activates an external mechanism (e.g., a gun) to track and engage the target automatically.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Some people just can‚Äôt resist grabbing your stuff without asking ‚Äî especially your laptop. They sneak around, take it when you‚Äôre not looking, and leave you scrambling. It‚Äôs annoying, frustrating, and honestly, kinda rude.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
My project protects my laptop from unauthorized people who try to take it without my consent. It specifically targets blacklisted individuals, and if they stay near my laptop for more than 5 seconds, the system automatically tracks them and activates a shooting mechanism to stop them.
